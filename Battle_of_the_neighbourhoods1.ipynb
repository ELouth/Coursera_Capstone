        "Opening a restaurant in a large city like Toronto can be challenging. Especially if you are not familiar with the area. I want to open an upscale restaurant somewhere in the downtown area. However, I need to find an area of the city where people are willing to pay premium prices for high-quality food. Therefore, I aim to find which parts of the downtown area of Toronto have expensive restaurants so I can consider also opening my restaurant in an area with sucessful high-priced restaurants. "
